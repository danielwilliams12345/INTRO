Hi, I’m @danielwilliams12345

On here, I plan to share my code (Python and soon-to-be Java).
I want to publish my code in hopes for others to improve it. 
I also want to discover the projects of other creators to further my knowledge and understanding

In the future, my goal is to be a pentester (aka vulnerability analyst). Along with software development
I do want to be knowledgeable in many fields, not just my goals (if you are reading this, is there advice on a way to pursue my career(s)

My code will be private, but very open to sharing with others for whatever reason. 
But yes, I prefer people ask for my code, so I can also learn a little and be updated on changes (in case they are helpful)

Feel free to chat with me (even if you have a random question about food), I want to do grow and help others do the same! 

Best!

- Daniel
